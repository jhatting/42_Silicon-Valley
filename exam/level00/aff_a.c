// argc is the argument count.
// an argument count can be understood as the following:
// when you run ./<filename> ... to execute a program, this is considered 1 argument
// when you run ./<filename> "whatever is in these quotes" this is considered 2 arguments
// when you run ./<filename> "whatever is in these quotes" "and these" this is considered 3 arguments
// argc essentially just keeps track of the number of arguments the user uses.
//
// the question says specifically asks us  "if the number of parameters is not 1"
// parameters (in this case) is the arguments that follows the initial command: ./<filename>
// so ./<filename> "whatever is in these quotes" is considered 1 parameter.
//
// **argv (argument vector) takes arguments as input
// argv takes .<filename> "whatever is in these quotes"
// and passes .<filename> as argv[0] and "whatever is in these quotes" as argv[1] as parameters
// 
// notice that **argv is a pointer to a pointer
// this pointer points to *str
// using this relationship, we can pass "whatever is in these quotes"
// as argv[1] through *str so we can print out the output using arrays
