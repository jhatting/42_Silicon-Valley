# 42_Silicon-Valley
Repository of my work during the 42 program, that follows a logical sequence of 17 long-lasting skills that speak to businesses. These skills also have the same fundamental element: personal adaptability, learning, coping and solving new challenges that they will inevitably face regularly. Even if it has a few obligatory paths, 42â€™s program is individually tailored throughout their educational experience. Many classical themes are addressed in order to develop the skills they contain, like:  Computer Science / Programming Innovation Infrastructures Personal Development and Expression Entrepreneurship

Every day for four weeks and even on weekends, we have to do exercises and projects in C. This piscine starts from zero and does not ask for any prior knowledge... apart from knowing how to use a mouse and a keyboard.

Disclaimer: I've fixed a lot of the exercises, and made new solutions to previous ones that I didn't completed during my piscine. These scores don't show the final mark of this repository.
